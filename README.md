Final Project:  Jill Duhl


What:  A knitting related web site.
Why: I like to knit.  Family and friends have suggested that I try to sell things I have made on a site like Etsy.  So, I want to build a basic site that will show what I have made and allow someone to contact me with their requests or for more information.
